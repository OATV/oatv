			<h2>Who We<br/> Are Not</h2>
			
			<h3>An Angel Investor</h3>
			<p>Angel investors are a critical piece of the startup ecosystem and typically write checks of $10k to $100k in a single round of funding. We are not angel investors. Our check size ranges between $500k and $1M and we reserve an additional $3M for each investment we make.</p>
            
            <h3>The Strategic Investment Arm of O&rsquo;Reilly Media</h3>
            <p>We love O&rsquo;Reilly Media. They are a general partner in both OATV funds and their thinking shapes many of the trends we invest behind. But we are not their strategic investment arm. If you're seeking funding for a company related to publishing, conferences or any line of business core to O&rsquo;Reilly, you'd do best to approach them directly.</p>
        
        	<h3>High Volume Investors</h3>
			<p>There are many angels and seed stage funds that do a high volume of investing each year&mdash;multiple investments a month, double-digit investments per year. In contrast, we make 2-4 investments per partner, per year. Not only does this map to our personal dispositions, it allows us to focus on providing a high level of service to the few companies we choose to get behind.</p>        
        	
        	<h3>A Traditional Venture Capital Firm</h3>
			<p>Traditional venture capital firms consider early stage investing to be Series A rounds of $3-5M. We do not lead rounds of that size, nor do we lead or participate in Series B-Z rounds. There are many great firms which do. We aren&rsquo;t one of them.</p>
